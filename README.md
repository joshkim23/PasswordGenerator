# PasswordGenerator

This is a strong password generator that I built from scratch using Vanilla JS. Practicing DOM manipulation, using objects, modifying strings and arrays

The user specifies the length of the desired password and what types of characters the user wishes to be in his or her password. Then each character of the password is generated randomly from their selections.
